<p>On 11/23/2024, I performed at a piano recital hosted by my piano
teacher, Andrew. I was the only adult performer.</p>
<p>View my performance <a href="IMG_6518.mp4">here</a>. I am proud that
I did it, mistakes and all!</p>
<p>Here’s what Andrew said after I finished:</p>
<pre><code>Jack played when he was younger, and then just started taking lessons a few months ago. You can learn stuff.</code></pre>
<p>:)</p>
<p>Thank you Catherine for taking me and supporting me :)</p>
