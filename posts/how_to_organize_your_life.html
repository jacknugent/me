<h2 id="step-1-organize-your-apartment">Step 1: Organize Your
Apartment</h2>
<p>I have the coolest neighbors in D.C – so cool that we have our own
communial christmas tree in our hallway, along with future plans to hang
our neighbor Lloyd‘s paintings.</p>
<p>The decorating event was adorable – we opened our doors, played
music, and shared snacks while we took turns with lights and ornaments
in our hot, narrow hallway.</p>
<p>There are several layers of reasoning to explain why I have never
seen, or even heard of, another apartment where the residents decorate
their hallways together. The simplest explanation comes from the most
obvious place: our lease.</p>
<pre><code>The Tenant shall not ... permit any act by a Tenant’s family or guests which will unreasonably interfere with the rights, comforts, or conveniences of other occupants of the building.</code></pre>
<p>This clause, quite reasonably, protects Tenants from unilaterally
making an apartment uncomfortable or inconvenient to live in. If I set
up a hallway decoration another resident did not like, our building
manager would rightfully remove it, so, unsurprisingly, a resident must
get approval from the entire floor, and building manager, to make any
alterations.</p>
<p>I‘m sure most residents would enjoy communally decorated hallways.
But almost none have them, because A) Tenants do not know their
Neighbors well enough to casually plan decorations, and B) who is going
to go door-knocking for something so trivial?</p>
<p>The decorations themselves are not a big deal. The big deal is what
their rarity represents: our world not built for communal actions. The
challenges exist not just in legal agreeents, but in physical design. In
<em>Happy City</em>, author Charles Montgomery discusses how
conventional apartment layouts aren’t conducive to casual chatter:</p>
<pre><code>The problem was that the long-corridor design made it almost impossible for them to choose whom they bumped into and how often. There was no in-between space. You were either in your room or out in the public zone of the hallway.</code></pre>
<p>We’ve all felt this – the awkward, timeboxed elevator ride, a means
of transporation not for socializing. Small-talk at best, assuming no
headphones in use, and even then, small-talk about what? The end result
is recognition, maybe a hello, but nothing more.</p>
<p>To put it another way, we are not Neighbors, but Tenants. Instead of
people living next door to other people, we are people occupying land
from a landlord.</p>
<p>So on the surface, hallway decorations are no big deal. But taking it
apart, it’s kind of a miracle. Decorating an apartment hallway is a
small but radical reimaging of the built environment, overcoming legal,
physical, and cultural hurdles to do so.</p>
<p>So how did we do it? In short, we organized.</p>
<p>But to explain how six neighbors organized on a single floor, we have
to look at how millions organized on a single island.</p>
