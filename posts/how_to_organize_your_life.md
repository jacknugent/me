## Step 1: Organize Your Apartment

I have the coolest neighbors in D.C – so cool that we have our own communial christmas tree in our hallway, along with future plans to hang our neighbor Lloyd‘s paintings.

The decortaing event was a sight to behold – we opened our doors, played music, and shared snacks while we took turns with lights and ornaments in our hot, narrow hallway.

There are several layers of reasoning to explain why I have never seen, or even heard of, another apartment where the residents decorate their hallways together. Here is the most literal, from our lease:

    The Tenant shall not ... permit any act by a Tenant’s family or guests which will unreasonably interfere with the rights, comforts, or conveniences of other occupants of the building.

This clause, quite reasonably, protects Tenants from unilaterally making an apartment uncomfortable or inconvenient to live in. If I set up a hallway decoration another resident did not like, our building manager would rightfully remove it, so, unsurprisingly, a resident must get approval from the entire floor, and building manager, to make any alterations.

I‘m sure most residents would enjoy communally decorated hallways. But almost none have them, because A) Tenants do not know their Neighbors well enough to casually plan decorations, and B) who is going to go door-knocking for something so trivial?

The decorations themselves are not a big deal. The big deal is what their rarity represents: our world is not built for community. Consider the description of apartments in _Happy City_:

In summary – and at the risk of hyperbole – decorating an apartment hallway is a radical reimaging of the built environment, overcoming legal, physical, and cultural hurdles

So how did we do it? We organized.
