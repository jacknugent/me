## Step 1: Organize Your Apartment

I have the coolest neighbors in D.C – so cool that we have our own communial christmas tree in our hallway, along with future plans to hang our neighbor Lloyd‘s paintings.

The decorating event was adorable – we opened our doors, played music, and shared snacks while we took turns with lights and ornaments in our hot, narrow hallway.

There are several layers of reasoning to explain why I have never seen, or even heard of, another apartment where the residents decorate their hallways together. The simplest explanation comes from the most obvious place: our lease.

    The Tenant shall not ... permit any act by a Tenant’s family or guests which will unreasonably interfere with the rights, comforts, or conveniences of other occupants of the building.

This clause, quite reasonably, protects Tenants from unilaterally making an apartment uncomfortable or inconvenient to live in. If I set up a hallway decoration another resident did not like, our building manager would rightfully remove it, so, unsurprisingly, a resident must get approval from the entire floor, and building manager, to make any alterations.

I‘m sure most residents would enjoy communally decorated hallways. But almost none have them, because A) Tenants do not know their Neighbors well enough to casually plan decorations, and B) who is going to go door-knocking for something so trivial?

The decorations themselves are not a big deal. The big deal is what their rarity represents: our world not built for communal actions. The challenges exist not just in legal agreeents, but in physical design. In _Happy City_, author Charles Montgomery discusses how conventional apartment layouts aren't conducive to casual chatter:

    The problem was that the long-corridor design made it almost impossible for them to choose whom they bumped into and how often. There was no in-between space. You were either in your room or out in the public zone of the hallway.

We've all felt this – the awkward, timeboxed elevator ride, a means of transporation not for socializing. Small-talk at best, assuming no headphones in use, and even then, small-talk about what? The end result is recognition, maybe a hello, but nothing more.

To put it another way, we are not Neighbors, but Tenants. Instead of people living next door to other people, we are people occupying land from a landlord.

So on the surface, hallway decorations are no big deal. But taking it apart, it's kind of a miracle. Decorating an apartment hallway is a small but radical reimaging of the built environment, overcoming legal, physical, and cultural hurdles to do so.

So how did we do it? In short, we organized.

But to explain how six neighbors organized on a single floor, we have to look at how millions organized on a single island.

On my hall, we found what we had in common: we wanted to brighten up our dreary hallway. I‘m sure everyone agreed to it for slightly different reasons – it was Karim‘s idea, and I know he expressly wanted to make the hallway a friendly, neighborly place, but maybe others simply said yes to be agreeable, or to open up the hallway for future communal activities, like playing fetch with a dog on a cold, winter day (which I am all for, by the way).

Honestly, I have so few complaints about the building. It‘s rent-controlled, and our building manager Joe lives on the premise, and I have _never_ had an issue getting something fixed or addressed. Joe is genuinely great.

But I do wish I had more say in how it operates. I‘d like to know when units are vacant, and I want our front courtyard to have benches and tables. I also want clearer guidelines on renovation policies, like when I can get new carpets or paint.

People support a union (decorating a hallway), but there are fewer unions than ever
