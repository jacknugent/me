## Step 1: Organize Your Apartment

I have the coolest neighbors in D.C – so cool that we have our own communial christmas tree in our hallway, along with future plans to hang our neighbor Lloyd‘s paintings.

The decortaing event was a sight to behold – we opened our doors, played music, and shared snacks while we took turns with lights and ornaments in our hot, narrow hallway.

There are several layers of reasoning to explain why I have never seen, or even heard of, another apartment where the residents decorate their hallways together. The simplest explanation comes from the most obvious place: our lease

    The Tenant shall not ... permit any act by a Tenant’s family or guests which will unreasonably interfere with the rights, comforts, or conveniences of other occupants of the building.

This clause, quite reasonably, protects Tenants from unilaterally making an apartment uncomfortable or inconvenient to live in. If I set up a hallway decoration another resident did not like, our building manager would rightfully remove it, so, unsurprisingly, a resident must get approval from the entire floor, and building manager, to make any alterations.

I‘m sure most residents would enjoy communally decorated hallways. But almost none have them, because A) Tenants do not know their Neighbors well enough to casually plan decorations, and B) who is going to go door-knocking for something so trivial?

The decorations themselves are not a big deal. The big deal is what their rarity represents: our world not built for communal actions. The challenges exist not just in legal agreeents, but in physical design. In _Happy City_, author Charles Montgomery discusses how conventional apartment layouts aren't conducive to casual chatter:

    The problem was that the long-corridor design made it almost impossible for them to choose whom they bumped into and how often. There was no in-between space. You were either in your room or out in the public zone of the hallway.

We've all felt this – the awkward, timeboxed elevator ride, a means of transporation not for socializing. Small-talk at best, assuming no headphones in use, and even then, small-talk about what? The end result is recognition, maybe a hello, but nothing more.

To put it another way, we are not Neighbors, but Tenants. Instead of people living next door to other people, we are people occupying land from a landlord.

So on the surface, hallway decorations are no big deal. But taking it apart, it's kind of a miracle. Decorating an apartment hallway is a radical reimaging of the built environment, overcoming legal, physical, and cultural hurdles to do so.

So how did we do it? We organized.
