# Piano Recital

On 11/23/2024, I went to a piano recital hosted by my piano teacher, Andrew. I was the only adult.

View my performance [here](IMG_6518.mp4). A few mistakes, but I am proud that I did it!

Here's what Andrew said after I finished:

    Jack played when he was younger, and then just started taking lessons a few months ago. You can learn stuff.

Thank you Catherine for taking me and supporting me :)
