# My First Adult Piano Recital

On 11/23/2024, I performed at a piano recital hosted by my piano teacher, Andrew. I was the only adult performer.

View my performance [here](IMG_6518.mp4). I am proud that I did it, mistakes and all! In the beginning of the video, you can kind of see the dad making fun of me.

Here's what Andrew said after I finished:

    Jack played when he was younger, and then just started taking lessons a few months ago. You can learn stuff.

Thank you Catherine for taking me and supporting me :)
