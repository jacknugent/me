<p>I identify as a Digital Minimalist. I found the term after reading
“How to Break Up With Your Smartphone” by Catherine Price, which
inspired me to search online for other techniques to reduce my
screentime. From there, I found the <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/digitialminimalism">/r/DigitalMinimalism</a>
subreddit.</p>
<p>Here are some foundational reasons I feel passionate about this
topic:</p>
<ul>
<li>I find it unfulfilling to scroll infinitely on my phone/laptop.</li>
<li>I get more joy and connection through offline (or thoughtfully
online) activities.</li>
<li>I enjoy the beautiful simplicity of analogue devices not connected
to the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>On this page, I will catalogue steps I am taking towards Digital
Minimalism. I hope you find them helpful or inspiring. At any point,
this page may look like a work in progress because so am I.</p>
