<p>Last updated: 11.17.2024</p>
<p>I identify as a Digital Minimalist. I found the term after reading
“How to Break Up With Your Smartphone” by Catherine Price, which
inspired me to search online for other techniques to reduce my
screentime. From there, I found the <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/digitialminimalism">/r/DigitalMinimalism</a>
subreddit.</p>
<p>Here are some foundational reasons I feel passionate about this
topic:</p>
<ul>
<li>I find it unfulfilling to scroll infinitely on my phone/laptop.</li>
<li>I get more joy and connection through offline (or thoughtfully
online) activities.</li>
<li>I enjoy the beautiful simplicity of analogue devices not connected
to the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>On this page, I will catalogue steps I am taking towards Digital
Minimalism. I hope you find them helpful or inspiring. At any point,
this page may look like a work in progress because so am I.</p>
<h2 id="keep-your-phone-out-of-your-bedroom">Keep Your Phone Out of Your
Bedroom</h2>
<p>This step was the easiest and most fruitful for me. I bought a
regular alarm clock and charge my phone outside of my bedroom. And it
turns out, I have never missed something important because my phone was
in the other room.</p>
<p>However. If I am on-call for work (the bane of my existence), I bring
my iPhone in for the alerts. Maybe I get a very simple flip phone just
for this.</p>
<h2 id="delete-tiktok-twitter-instagram-and-facebook">Delete TikTok,
Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook</h2>
<p>I deleted all of these.</p>
<p>I can see why this step may seem harder to justify for others. Maybe
TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook let some connect with others
and stay informed.</p>
<p>But I felt like Twitter and TikTok did not make me better informed,
and Instagram and Facebook did not connect me to friends and family.</p>
<p>I notice many people my age only have Facebook for Facebook
Marketplace. You should try out <a href="craigslist.org">Craigslist</a>
again, which is the Internet at it‘s most pure and gorgeous!</p>
<p>On a more basic level, I feel freer having less of a digital
footprint.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-reddit-and-youtube">Keeping Reddit and YouTube?</h2>
<p>I use SelfControl to block Reddit/YouTube whenever I feel like I’m on
them too much. My compromises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://old.reddit.com/">old reddit</a> layout</li>
<li><a
href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/6364666?hl=en">Delete
my watch history on YouTube</a>, which completely disables
recommendations.</li>
</ul>
