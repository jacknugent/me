<p>I identify as a Digital Minimalist. I found the term after reading
“How to Break Up With Your Smartphone” by Catherine Price, which
inspired me to search online for other techniques to reduce my
screentime. From there, I found the <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/digitialminimalism">/r/DigitalMinimalism</a>
subreddit.</p>
<p>Here are some foundational reasons I feel passionate about this
topic:</p>
<ul>
<li>I find it unfulfilling to scroll infinitely on my phone/laptop.</li>
<li>I get more joy and connection through offline (or thoughtfully
online) activities.</li>
<li>I enjoy the beautiful simplicity of analogue (or simple digital)
devices not connected to the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>On this page, I will catalogue steps I am taking towards Digital
Minimalism. At any point, this page may look like a work in progress
because so am I.</p>
<h2 id="keep-my-phone-out-of-my-bedroom">Keep My Phone Out of My
Bedroom</h2>
<p>This step was the easiest and most fruitful for me. I bought a
regular alarm clock and charge my phone outside of my bedroom. And it
turns out, I have never missed something important because my phone was
in the other room.</p>
<p>However. If I am on-call for work (the bane of my existence), I bring
my iPhone in for the alerts. Maybe I use my basic tablet just for
this.</p>
<h2 id="delete-tiktok-twitter-instagram-and-facebook">Delete TikTok,
Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook</h2>
<p>I deleted all of these. Not just deleting the app, but deleting the
entire account.</p>
<p>I tried to use <a href="craigslist.org">Craigslist</a> instead of the
popular Facebook Marketplace, but it seems like most people have
switched over. So this is a bummer. It’s made me use Ebay more.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-reddit-and-youtube">Keeping Reddit and YouTube?</h2>
<p>I use SelfControl to block Reddit/YouTube whenever I feel like I’m on
them too much. My compromises:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use <a href="https://old.reddit.com/">old reddit</a> layout</li>
<li><a
href="https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/6364666?hl=en">Delete
my watch history on YouTube</a>, which completely disables
recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="making-my-mac-boring">Making My Mac Boring</h2>
<p>My goal - by default, my Mac is a blank, black screen. That
means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hide the top bar by default</li>
<li>Hide the Dock</li>
<li>No apps/files on Desktop</li>
<li>Black screensaver</li>
<li>No notifications flashing on the screen <em>except</em>
time-sensitive meetings and messages.</li>
</ul>
<p>With notifications, I like to start with none, then add back what I
need. That makes each notification a choice.</p>
<h2 id="making-my-iphone-boring">Making My IPhone Boring</h2>
<figure>

<p>Similar to my Mac:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiding everything I can</li>
<li>No fun backgrounds</li>
<li>Very few notifications</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-grayscale-connundrum">The Grayscale Connundrum</h2>
<p>Apparently Grayscale reduces engagement. In my experience, I just
turn it back to color over time. My compromise is to such a
<em>little</em> bit of color from the screen instead.</p>
<h2 id="buying-a-flip-phone-and-giving-up">Buying a Flip Phone and
Giving Up</h2>
<p>It’s too hard. I need maps, Signal, WhatsApp, and
taxi-calling-apps.</p>
