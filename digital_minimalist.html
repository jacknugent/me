<p>Last updated: 11.17.2024</p>
<p>I identify as a Digital Minimalist. I found the term after reading
“How to Break Up With Your Smartphone” by Catherine Price, which
inspired me to search online for other techniques to reduce my
screentime. From there, I found the <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/digitialminimalism">/r/DigitalMinimalism</a>
subreddit.</p>
<p>Here are some foundational reasons I feel passionate about this
topic:</p>
<ul>
<li>I find it unfulfilling to scroll infinitely on my phone/laptop.</li>
<li>I get more joy and connection through offline (or thoughtfully
online) activities.</li>
<li>I enjoy the beautiful simplicity of analogue devices not connected
to the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>On this page, I will catalogue steps I am taking towards Digital
Minimalism. I hope you find them helpful or inspiring. At any point,
this page may look like a work in progress because so am I.</p>
<h2 id="keep-your-phone-out-of-your-bedroom">Keep Your Phone Out of Your
Bedroom</h2>
<p>This step was the easiest and most fruitful for me. Buy a regular
alarm clock and charge your phone elsewhere – in another room, ideally,
but out-of-reach of your bed also works.</p>
<p>People will justify <em>not</em> doing this is by thinking they will
miss something important. I have never missed something important
because my phone was in another room while I was sleeping.</p>
<p>However. If I am on-call for work (the bane of my existence), I have
an old iPhone set up in my bedroom for alerts. So if you <em>really</em>
have some work (or personal) reason to be reachable while asleep, invest
in an old, very cheap smartphone that can receive alerts.</p>
<p>Really, there is no good excuse for not following this step. If you
want to use your smartphone less, this is how you begin.</p>
<h2 id="delete-tiktok-twitter-instagram-and-facebook">Delete TikTok,
Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook</h2>
<p>Next up – delete everything. Don‘t just delete the app. Export the
data you want to keep (photos, posts, etc. – every app will let you do
this), then, <em>delete the account</em>.</p>
<p>I can see why this step may seem harder to justify. I guess some
people think they use TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook to
connect with others and to stay informed.</p>
<p>Do you think people who use Twitter and TikTok are better informed?
Do you think people who use Instagram and Facebook are better connected
to friends and family? I don’t think a friend‘s highly-curated vacation
photos actually keep you connected with them. I also think seeing a
Facebook post is no substitution for a phone call.</p>
<p>I notice many people my age only have Facebook for Facebook
Marketplace. Time to go back to <a href="craigslist.org">Craigslist</a>,
which is the Internet at it‘s most pure and gorgeous!</p>
<p>On a more basic level, I feel freer having less of a digital
footprint.</p>
