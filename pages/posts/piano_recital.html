<p>On 11/23/2024, I performed at a piano recital hosted by my piano
teacher, Andrew. I was the only adult performer. For some context, <a
href="competition.mp4">here</a> was some of my competition.</p>
<p>View my performance <a href="IMG_6518.mp4">here</a>. I am proud that
I did it, mistakes and all! In the beginning of the video, you can kind
of see the dad making fun of me.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s what Andrew said after I finished:</p>
<pre><code>Jack played when he was younger, and then just started taking lessons a few months ago. You can learn stuff.</code></pre>
<p>:)</p>
<p>Thank you Catherine for taking me and supporting me :)</p>
