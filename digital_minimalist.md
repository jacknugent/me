# Digital Minimalism

Last updated: 11.17.2024

I identify as a Digital Minimalist. I found the term after reading “How to Break Up With Your Smartphone” by Catherine Price, which inspired me to search online for other techniques to reduce my screentime. From there, I found the [/r/DigitalMinimalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitialminimalism) subreddit.

Here are some foundational reasons I feel passionate about this topic:

- I find it unfulfilling to scroll infinitely on my phone/laptop.
- I get more joy and connection through offline (or thoughtfully online) activities.
- I enjoy the beautiful simplicity of analogue devices not connected to the internet.

On this page, I will catalogue steps I am taking towards Digital Minimalism. I hope you find them helpful or inspiring. At any point, this page may look like a work in progress because so am I.

## Keep Your Phone Out of Your Bedroom

This step was the easiest and most fruitful for me. I bought a regular alarm clock and charge my phone outside of my bedroom. And it turns out, I have never missed something important because my phone was in the other room.

However. If I am on-call for work (the bane of my existence), I bring my iPhone in for the alerts. Maybe I get a very simple flip phone just for this.

## Delete TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook

I deleted all of these.

I can see why this step may seem harder to justify for others. Maybe TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook let some connect with others and stay informed.

But I felt like Twitter and TikTok did not make me better informed, and Instagram and Facebook did not connect me to friends and family.

I notice many people my age only have Facebook for Facebook Marketplace. You should try out [Craigslist](craigslist.org) again, which is the Internet at it‘s most pure and gorgeous!

On a more basic level, I feel freer having less of a digital footprint.

## Keeping Reddit and YouTube?

I use SelfControl to block Reddit/YouTube whenever I feel like I'm on them too much. My compromises:

- Use [old reddit](https://old.reddit.com/) layout
- [Delete my watch history on YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtubemusic/answer/6364666?hl=en), which completely disables recommendations.
