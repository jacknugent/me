# Digital Minimalism

Last updated: 11.17.2024

I identify as a Digital Minimalist. I found the term after reading “How to Break Up With Your Smartphone” by Catherine Price, which inspired me to search online for other techniques to reduce my screentime. From there, I found the [/r/DigitalMinimalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitialminimalism) subreddit.

Here are some foundational reasons I feel passionate about this topic:

- I find it unfulfilling to scroll infinitely on my phone/laptop.
- I get more joy and connection through offline (or thoughtfully online) activities.
- I enjoy the beautiful simplicity of analogue devices not connected to the internet.

On this page, I will catalogue steps I am taking towards Digital Minimalism. I hope you find them helpful or inspiring. At any point, this page may look like a work in progress because so am I.

## Keep Your Phone Out of Your Bedroom

This step was the easiest and most fruitful for me. Buy a regular alarm clock and charge your phone elsewhere – in another room, ideally, but out-of-reach of your bed also works.

People will justify _not_ doing this is by thinking they will miss something important. I have never missed something important because my phone was in another room while I was sleeping.

However. If I am on-call for work (the bane of my existence), I have an old iPhone set up in my bedroom for alerts. So if you _really_ have some work (or personal) reason to be reachable while asleep, invest in an old, very cheap smartphone that can receive alerts.

Really, there is no good excuse for not following this step. If you want to use your smartphone less, this is how you begin.

## Delete TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook

Next up – delete everything. Don‘t just delete the app. Export the data you want to keep (photos, posts, etc. – every app will let you do this), then, _delete the account_.

I can see why this step may seem harder to justify. I guess some people think they use TikTok, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook to connect with others and to stay informed.

Do you think people who use Twitter and TikTok are better informed? Do you think people who use Instagram and Facebook are better connected to friends and family? I don't think a friend‘s highly-curated vacation photos actually keep you connected with them. I also think seeing a Facebook post is no substitution for a phone call.

I notice many people my age only have Facebook for Facebook Marketplace. Time to go back to [Craigslist](craigslist.org), which is the Internet at it‘s most pure and gorgeous!

On a more basic level, I feel freer having less of a digital footprint.
