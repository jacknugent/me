# Digital Minimalism

Last updated: 11.9.2024

I identify as a Digital Minimalist. I found the term after reading “How to Break Up With Your Smartphone” by Catherine Price, which inspired me to search online for other techniques to reduce my screentime. From there, I found the [/r/DigitalMinimalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/digitialminimalism) subreddit.

Here are some foundational reasons I feel passionate about this topic:

- I find it unfulfilling to scroll infinitely on my phone/laptop.
- I get more joy and connection through offline (or thoughtfully online) activities.
- I enjoy the beautiful simplicity of analogue devices not connected to the internet.

On this page, I will catalogue steps I am taking towards Digital Minimalism. I hope you find them helpful or inspiring. At any point, this page may look like a work in progress because so am I.
